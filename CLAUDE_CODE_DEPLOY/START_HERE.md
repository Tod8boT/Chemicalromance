## 📋 **READ THESE FILES FIRST (IN ORDER):**

1. **REFERENCE_WORKFLOWS.md** ← Study existing patterns
2. **SESSION_1_FACEBOOK.md** ← Your first 6 workflows  
3. **SESSION_2_IMAGES.md** ← Your next 7 workflows
4. **TECHNICAL_SPECS.md** ← Implementation details
5. **TOKEN_OPTIMIZATION.md** ← Save credits guide

## 🎯 **YOUR MISSION OVERVIEW:**

### **What You're Building:**
Transform CREMO from manual content creation → AI-driven automation with Facebook intelligence and text overlay customization

### **Current Status:**
- ✅ **50% workflows exist** (study these first)
- ✅ **Patterns proven** (copy these structures)  
- ❌ **Missing integrations** (your job to create)
- ❌ **System inactive** (your job to activate)

### **Your Value:**
- **Learn from existing** (faster than building from scratch)
- **Enhance what works** (improve proven patterns)
- **Create missing links** (complete the system)
- **Make it production-ready** (just add credentials)

## ⚡ **KEY SUCCESS FACTORS:**

### **1. Text Overlay = PRIORITY 1**
- Arc curve feature is BRAND CRITICAL
- Thai language support essential
- Mobile optimization required
- Study `BrEps7QE3eBia4U4` first

### **2. Learn Before Creating**
- Always study reference workflows first
- Copy proven node patterns
- Only innovate where needed
- Use `n8n_get_workflow_structure` to learn

### **3. Production Ready**
- All workflows must be deployable immediately
- Only need to add credentials + sheet names
- Include proper error handling
- Test end-to-end flows

## 📞 **WHEN YOU NEED HELP:**

**Ask for clarification on:**
- Workflow integration points
- Google Sheets structure
- Credential naming conventions  
- Thai language requirements
- Arc curve specifications

**DON'T:**
- Create workflows from scratch without studying references
- Use different naming conventions  
- Skip error handling
- Forget mobile optimization
